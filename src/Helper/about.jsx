          "Iâ€™am John Lloyd Butay. I reside in the Philippines. I graduated from Mariano Marcos State University's Computer Engineering program. I started drawing and creating at an early age, and the majority of my design talents and expertise are self-taught. I became interested in programming after learning about web development in high school. It interested me and drew me in, so I chose to follow this job. Even though I pursued a career as a coder, my natural gift for arts and design lingered. As a result, I learned myself about multimedia design. I am capable of creating professional and dynamic websites by combining cutting-edge technology with my programming experience.",
        text2:
          "I will not stick around on just doing Front End development projects. My goal is to take it to the next level of becoming a Full Stack Developer and become one of the world's top designers, so now, I am working towards it. I have prepared myself to accept the challenges into this ever changing world and I will try my very best to achieve my dreams and goals.",
